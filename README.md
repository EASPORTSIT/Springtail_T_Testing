# Springtail_T_Testing
North Dakota produces 6.5 tons of sugar beets annually, a staple crop facing challenges from the native springtail pest. In this experiment, radishes will replace sugar beets as they grow faster, and two treatments- undiluted white vinegar and neem oil- will be tested for their effectiveness in fending off springtails while preserving plant health.
